## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Add the Script Tag

To integrate the **SVC Client** into your website, add the following `<script>` tag to your HTML file. This will load the script from the **jsDelivr CDN**:

    htmlCopy<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wesdevteam/svc-client@latest/dist/svc.min.js"></script>

This script is automatically hosted, and you don’t need to download or host it yourself.

## 📝 Usage

Once the script is included in your HTML file, you can start using the **SVC Client** for tracking site visitors.

### Example:

```html
Copy<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Visitor Counter</title>
   
  </head>
  <body>
     <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wesdevteam/svc-client@latest/dist/svc.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```


## 📈 Versioning

The **SVC Client** is versioned using **Git tags**. You can specify the version tag if you need to use a specific version, such as `v1.0.0`.

### Example:

To use a specific version:

    htmlCopy<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wesdevteam/svc-client@v1.0.0/dist/svc.min.js"></script>

If you prefer always to get the latest version, use:

    htmlCopy<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wesdevteam/svc-client@latest/dist/svc.min.js"></script>
